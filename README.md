## Project Overview
This application demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming** (OOP) in Python. It consists of a few basic classes that represent members of a streaming platform. The app leverages **Streamlit** to create an interactive web interface that allows users to view and manage members' subscription statuses.

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the files):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alfandika-ap/simple-python-oop-with-streamlit.git
   cd simple-python-oop-with-streamlit
   ```
   
2. **Install the required dependencies** using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This will install the necessary libraries, including:
    - streamlit
    - Any other dependencies your app might require.
